# MediaCenter
MediaCenter provides to a community with a web page that would allow them to post a set of media items( books, video games, DVDs, etc ).
The project is made of HTML, CSS on front-end side and java on the back-end, using Jax-RS spec with the Jersey implementation. We chose Apache Tomcat as the server.
